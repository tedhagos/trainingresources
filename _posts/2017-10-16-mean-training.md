## Contact details

* **email** ted@thelogbox.com, tedhagos@gmail.com
* **twitter** @lovescaffeine

**Lecture notes** can be found at [tedhagos.gitbooks.io][meanbook]. This is a work in progress, it is quite possible that the training sessions will finish first before this gets completed. PDF version of the lecture notes can be downloaded from the site.

The preworked code examples are in [github/mean-training][meantraining]. You should really try to download it early on in the training sessions so you can read ahead.

## Lecture codes

Whenever there are live coding samples, they will be posted as a Gist on github.com. Here are the links.
